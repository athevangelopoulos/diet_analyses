Species diet analyses

## Prey taxa proportions and relative importance in the diet
Script proportions computes prey items frequencies in the stomachs (%F) and their proportions in numbers (%N) and weight (%W). It also computes the IRI index and its % form (%IRI). The results are exported as a .csv file. The %N, %W and %I values are also plotted as pie-donut graphs.
