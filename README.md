Species diet analyses

## Prey taxa proportions and relative importance in the diet

diet_proportions.R computes prey taxa frequencies in the stomachs (%F) and their proportions in numbers (%N) and weight (%W) in the stomach contents. It also computes the IRI index and its % form (%IRI). The computed indices are exported as a .csv file. The %N, %W and %IRI values are also plotted as pie-donut graphs and exported as .png files.

The [original version](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/68095243/piedonut-how-to-change-color-of-pie-and-donut) of the function that plots the pie-donut graphs in pie_donut_full.R was posted on stackoverflow by Am√©lie Gourdon-Kanhukamwe. The scipt was adapted here to maintain the colors of prey taxonomic categories across plots.
